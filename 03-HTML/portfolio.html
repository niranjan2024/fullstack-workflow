        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="images/niranjan.jpg" alt="Niranjan Reddy Profile Photo" width="100">
        <p>
            I am a motivated Computer Science graduate with a strong foundation in software development and problem-solving. 
            I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering from Adikavi Nannaya University with a CGPA of 8.0. 
            I have hands-on experience in Java, SQL, and backend development, along with practical exposure to building efficient, 
            reliable applications during my internships and academic projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I worked as a Java Developer Intern, where I developed client-side applications, implemented socket-based communication, 
            designed user-friendly interfaces using Java Swing, and collaborated closely with server-side teams to ensure smooth client-server interactions. 
            I have also worked on machine learning projects such as Customer Churn Prediction, where I applied algorithms like Random Forest and SVM to 
            analyze data and deliver meaningful insights.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about technology and eager to start my career as a Software Engineer, where I can apply my technical skills, continue learning, 
            and contribute to innovative and impactful projects. I value teamwork, continuous improvement, and building solutions that solve real-world problems effectively.
        </p>

            <h3>Customer Churn Prediction</h3>
            <p>Developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn by analyzing customer demographics, usage behavior, and billing data. 
               Implemented algorithms such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify customers into churn and non-churn categories, 
               enabling businesses to identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.</p>

            <h3>Smart Attendance System</h3>
            <p>Designed and developed a face recognition–based attendance system using OpenCV. The system captures and recognizes faces in real time to automatically 
                mark attendance, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy and reliability in attendance management.</p>
